    I want to create a web page where I can save key terms, display them, or look them up
    I've already written most of the JavaScript
    But now I will write some HTML.
    I'll also have to write more JavaScript in order to have it be interactive

    <form name="dictionary">
        <input type="text">
    </form>

    <script src="dictionary.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
