// MY PLAN FOR THE GAME:

// TITLE:  SLC PUNK!
// premise:  you just moved to SLC and have to dodge bums, bad drivers, Mormon missionaries, and girls named Mckenzie

// INTRO: `It's Summer 1985. You just finished your junior year of high school in Oakland, CA when your parents decide to pick up and move everyone to Utah. Really, Utah??!! Yep! Back in the Bay your homies were down, the girlies were fine, you could get anywhere on BART, and Sundays were chill days not church days. Utah is going to be a very different beast...`
