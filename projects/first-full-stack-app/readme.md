For the First Full Stack App assignment, I decided to further develop my app called Stock Seeker. Originally, the site only allowed users to get real-time stock quotes via the Alpha Vantage free API. For this project, I added a back-end to the app which stores stock symbols, prices, and quantities "purchased". This allows a user to simulate having their own stock portfolio, and they can "buy" and "sell" stocks.

Technologies used for the front-end:  React, AXIOS, HTML, CSS.
Technologies used for the back-end:  MongoDB, Express, Mongoose.
