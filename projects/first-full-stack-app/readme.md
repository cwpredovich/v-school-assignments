# Project Description

For the First Full Stack App assignment, I decided to further develop my app called Stock Seeker. Originally, the site only allowed users to get real-time stock quotes via the Alpha Vantage free API. For this project, I added a back-end to the app which stores stock symbols, prices, and quantities "purchased". This allows a user to simulate having their own stock portfolio, and they can "buy" and "sell" stocks.

Technologies used for the front-end:  React, AXIOS, HTML, CSS.
Technologies used for the back-end:  MongoDB, Express, Mongoose.

# Important

There are currently two versions of the project. The old version, which is functional, makes use of the Buysell.js component. The new version, which is still under development, makes use of the BuySell2.js component. In order to switch between the two versions of the app, you just need to open ./client/src/App.js and comment out the component you wish to use (ie. Buysell.js) and uncomment the component you do not wish to use (ie. BuySell2.js).
